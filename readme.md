# CURL helper
CURL helper is the full documented (for now in Russian) simple PHP-library to do HTTP-requests. 
It's simple, reusable, expansible and has specific settings.
Example:
~~~
$helper = (new CurlHelper())
    ->setPost(false)
    ->setReturn(true)
    ->setHeader(false)
    ->setUserAgent('User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.79 Safari/537.36 Edge/14.14393')
    ->setUrl('https://www.google.com/search?q=hello+world')
;
$result = $helper->execute();
if (false === $result) {
    $errorMessage = $helper->getErrorMessage();
}
~~~
